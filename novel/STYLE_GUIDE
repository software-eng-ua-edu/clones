[Coding Style]

With the exception of indentation, follow the code style described at:

http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html

In particular, note the "Class Structure and Member Sort Order", "Imports", and "Acronyms in names" sections.

For indentation, use 4-space indents for blocks (NO tabs) (also use 4-spaces after line wraps).

For if/else stmts:

if (cond) {
    ;
} else {
    ;
}


[Javadoc]

Include javadoc tags in the following order:

@author      (classes and interfaces only, required)
@version     (classes and interfaces only, required. See footnote 1)
@param       (methods and constructors only)
@return      (methods only)
@exception   (@throws is a synonym added in Javadoc 1.2)
@see         
@since       
@serial      (or @serialField or @serialData)
@deprecated  (see How and When To Deprecate APIs)

Multiple @author tags should be listed in chronological order, with the creator of the class listed at the top.
