To build Wget with VC++ run configure.bat in the wget directory, and
then run nmake. At a certain point in time wget exposed some compiler
bugs in VC++ 5.0; VC++ 6.0 sp 5 is known to be safe.

If you want to build the help file you will need a copy of makeinfo to
convert wget.texi to rtf and html. I've made a copy available at
<URL:ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/wget/makeinfo.zip>.  This copy of
makeinfo is from the miktxt 1.10 archive available from ctan. You also
will need perl 5, one possibility is Activeperl (currently free) from
<URL:http://www.activestate.com>; you need to locate the download and
install instructions for the current version available (since the
packages and installation instructions change from time to time).

To configure Wget with VC++ with ssl support first get openssl,
compile it and install relevant headers and libraries where your
compiler can find them; then uncomment the SSL related lines in
windows\Makefile.src; then follow the normal instructions
(configure.bat and so on).
Usually at runtime some openssl libraries (currently ssleay32.dll and
libeay32.dll) will need to be available in your environment PATH.
