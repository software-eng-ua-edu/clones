To build Wget with VC++ 5.0 run configure.bat in the wget directory,
and then run nmake.  If you want to build the help file you will need
a copy of makinfo to convert wget.texi to rtf. I've made a copy
available at <URL:ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/wget/makeinfo.zip>.  This
copy of makeinfo is from the miktxt 1.10 archive available from ctan.

To configure Wget with VC++ with ssl support first get openssl,
compile it and install relevant headers and libraries where your
compiler can find them; then uncomment the SSL related lines in
windows\Makefile.src; then follow the normal instructions
(configure.bat and so on).
Usually at runtime some openssl libraries (currently ssleay32.dll and
libeay32.dll) will need to be available in your environment PATH.
