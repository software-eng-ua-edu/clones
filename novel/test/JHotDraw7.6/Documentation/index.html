  <p>  JHotDraw 7 defines a Java framework for structured drawing editors and for document-oriented applications. The two frameworks can be used independently of each other. </p>
  <p>The framework for structured drawing editors can be used to realize drawing editors for sketches, diagrams, and artistic
    drawings. Drawings can be animated and interactive. It is possible to back
    a drawing with a data model, allowing a structured drawing editor to be used
    as a user interface for a data model.</p>
  <p>The framework for document-oriented applications can be used to create applications which comply
    to platform-specific user interface guidelines. Such as the Apple Human Interface Guidelines and the Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines.</p>
  <h2>History of JHotDraw 7</h2>
  <p>JHotDraw 7  is based on Erich Gamma's JHotDraw,
      which is copyright 1996, 1997 by IFA Informatik and Erich Gamma.</p>
  <p> JHotDraw&nbsp;7
    is a major departure from  previous versions of JHotDraw &#8211; only
    the cornerstones of the original architecture remain. The API and almost
    every
    part of the
    implementation
    have been
    reworked
    to take advantage
    of the Java SE 6 platform.</p>
  <p>JHotDraw&nbsp;7 has been developed in 2004&#8211;2011
    by Werner Randelshofer.</p>
  <h2>Aims</h2>
  <p> The aim of making the original JHotDraw an open-source project
    is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> to gain a wider audience for this framework among developers</li>
    <li>to build
    new applications based upon JHotDraw</li>
    <li>to let application development influence
    the development of JHotDraw</li>
    <li>to add new and advanced features</li>
    <li>to drive its further development</li>
    <li>to port JHotDraw to new Java GUI toolkits</li>
    <li>to enhance and refactor the
    exisiting code</li>
    <li>to identify new design patterns and refactorings</li>
    <li>to make it an example
    for a well-designed and flexible framework</li>
    <li>to examine the relevance of new
    Java APIs to JHotDraw (e.g. usefulness of Java 2D API for JHotDraw)</li>
    <li> to learn and to have fun</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Any developer and software designer who wants to contribute is welcome!    </p>

        you some impressions about the usability and applicability of the JHotDraw
        framework to your requirements. This survey was based on version 5.2
        of JHotDraw, many of the problems and difficulties related
        to the framework
        have been resolved or have become irrelevant with JHotDraw 7.</li>
