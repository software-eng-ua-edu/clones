<p>JHotDraw 7 is a two-dimensional graphics framework for structured drawing
editors. It can be used to create many different editors from a simple doodle
program up to full fledged diagram editors and vector animation tools.</p>

<p>JHotDraw consists of the following parts:</p>

<p><em>Drawing Framework</em><br/>
    This framework provides the building blocks for the creation
    of vector drawing editors. It is located in the
    {@link org.jhotdraw.draw} package and its sub-packages.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Application Framework</em><br/>
    This framework supports the creation of document
    oriented applications which want to support platform-specific guidelines
    of the operating system on which they are being executed. It is located in the
    {@link org.jhotdraw.app} package and its sub-packages.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Sample Applications and Applets</em><br/>
    The samples are located in sub-packages of the
    {@code org.jhotdraw.samples} package.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Supporting classes</em><br/>
    The supporting classes are located in the remaining packages.
