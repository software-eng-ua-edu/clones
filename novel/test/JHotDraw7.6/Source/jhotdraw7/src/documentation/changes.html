      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Application Framework<br />
      Menus are now generated by the new MenuBuilder class instead of by the ApplicationModel.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.5<br />
      <font size="-1">2010-07-28</font></h3>
  <p>Enhancements and Changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drawing Framework<br />
      InputFormat and OutputFormat work now with URI's instead of files for identifying the storage location of a drawing.<br />
      The ResizeHandleKit supports now aspect preserving resizing by pressing the Alt- or Ctrl-Key.<br />
      The canvas area is now drawn by Drawing instead of DrawingView. <br />
      The ButtonFactory can now create color chooser popup buttons.<br />
      DOMStorable is not implemented by the Figure interface anymore allowing the implementation of figures which do not depend on this persistence framework.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>User Interface<br />
      An UI delegate for JColorChooser has been added to the &quot;Palette&quot; look and feel.<br />
      &nbsp;<br />
    </li>

      The user interface of the SVG example application has been improved.<br />
       <br />
    </li>
    <li>General<br />
      Java
      annotations have been added for clarity. @Nullable and @NotNull annotations specify allowed and disallowed occurences of null values. This is work in progress.<br />
        <br />
    </li>

  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.4<br />
      <font size="-1">2010-01-16</font></h3>
  <p>Enhancements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Application Framework: <br />
      The application framework works now with URI objects instead of File objects. This allows the creation of applications which are not file-based, such as network-based applications (browsers) and database-oriented applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Application Framework<br />
      Actions in the application framework are now organised in an ActionMap hierarchy.<br />
      (File-)URIChoosers are now created by the ApplicationModel instead by the View.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Drawing Framework<br />
      The package org.jhotdraw.draw has been split up into sub-packages.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Platform requirements: <br />
      Minimum platform requirement is now J2SE6. <br />
      The following third-party libraries have been removed: MRJAdapter.jar, swing-layout.jar. The following third-party source files have been removed: LinearGradientPaint and RadialGradientPaint from the Apache Batik library.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.3.1<br />
        <font size="-1">2009-10-18</font></strong></p>
  <p>This version fixes bugs found in 7.3. </p>
  <p>Notable enhancements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Default input map and action map are now handled by the DrawingEditor instead by AbstractTool.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notable fixes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy and paste did not work on Mac OS X 10.6.</li>
    <li>Figures which were very small caused rendering artefacts on DefaultDrawingView and caused ImageOutputFormat to crash.</li>
    <li>Setting a drawing on DefaultDrawingView caused flickering.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.3<br />
      <font size="-1">2009-10-11</font></h3>
  <p>Substantial changes and enhancements have been made to fix shortcomings and bugs of the frameworks
    and to improve the usability of drawing editors. </p>
  <p>Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/jhotdraw/changes/jhotdraw_7.2_vs_7.3/changes.html">JDiff report</a> for a detailed description of all API changes between JHotDraw 7.2 and 7.3.</p>
  <p>Notable changes are:</p>
  <p>General:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The documentation of framework interfaces and classes shows now the design patterns being used(like JHotDraw 6 did).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Drawing Framework:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The method names for setting and getting an attribute from a Figure have been shortened to get(AttributeKey), set(AttributeKey,Object). The sample code uses now these methods instead of the setter and getter methods in class AttributeKey.</li>
    <li>DefaultDrawingView uses now double buffering to improve editing performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Application Framework: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Worker class has been redesigned, to better support the common use cases of a Worker.</li>
    <li>Support for weak event listeners has been added to class AbstractBean. Weak event listeners help to prevent memory leaks in applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sample applications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SVG Sample: SVG Tiny 1.2 compliance has been improved. The SVGDrawingPanel can now more easily integrated as a component into an application. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.2<br />
      <font size="-1">2009-05</font> </h3>
  <p>Substantial changes and enhancements have been made to fix shortcomings and bugs of the frameworks
    and to improve the usability of drawing editors. </p>
  <p>Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/jhotdraw/changes/jhotdraw_7.1_vs_7.2/changes.html">JDiff report</a> for a detailed description of all API changes between JHotDraw 7.1 and 7.2.</p>
  <p>Drawing Framework:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The type safety of figure attributes has been improved, by making use of
      type tokens in AttributeKey and setter and getter methods with templates in
      Figure.</li>
    <li>The usability has been improved. Figures indicate there bounds when
      the mouse is moved over them. A substantial number of user interface classes for the creation of toolbars have been
      added, and are used by the SVG sample application.</li>
    <li>Drawing objects can now be serialized using the
      SerializationInputOutputFormat. This allows to easily implement short-term
      persistence for drawings (for example for clipboard support).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Application Framework: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The resource support has been reimplemented to be closer to JSR-296.
      Resource bundles can now use place holders in their values. The resource
      keys used by JHotDraw match now with the correspoinding JavaBeans property names.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.1<br />
      <font size="-1">2008-03</font> </h3>
  <p>Substantial changes have been made to fix shortcomings and bugs of the frameworks. </p>
  <p>Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/jhotdraw/changes/jhotdraw_7.0.9_vs_7.1/changes.html">JDiff report</a> for a detailed description of all API changes between JHotDraw 7.0.9 and 7.1.</p>
  <p>Drawing Framework:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most Figure methods with prefix basic… have been removed. These methods were used to support Undo/Redo by the Figure objects. In JHotDraw 7.1, this task has been moved to the Tool objects.</li>
    <li>The class structure has been  modified to gain more flexibility. Most notably, the Drawing interface extends now from the CompositeFigure interface.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Application Framework: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The experimental application framework based on JSR-296 has been removed, because it is not mature enough yet, to  keep JHotDraw in sync with it.</li>
    <li>The Project interface has been renamed to View, to be more in line with the upcoming Swing application framework JSR-296.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Samples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SVG: The background colors of SVG drawings can be set now. A number of bugs related to reading and writing gradients has been fixed. There is no support for editing gradients yet.</li>
    <li>ODG: This sample is not functional yet. It consists only of a few skeleton classes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.0.9<br />
      <font size="-1">2007-06-21</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Redesigned Undo/Redo handling for Figure attributes.</li>
    <li>Made many incompatible changes in all packages in order to pave the way
      for SVG support.</li>
    <li>Rewrote the SVG sample application.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the Draw package to make support for transformations on Figures
      possible, in order to be able to support SVG.</li>
    <li>Added Batik gradient classes, in order to be able to support SVG.</li>
    <li>Added new package org.jhotdraw.application based on JSR-296 &quot;appframework&quot;
      version 0.42. This package will replace org.jhotdraw.app in future versions. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.0.8<br />
      <font size="-1">2007-01-10</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Streamlined  interface names and class names to make it easier
      to learn the framework.</li>
    <li>InputFormat/OutputFormat interfaces and default implementations added
      to drawing framework.</li>
    <li>ImageHolderFigure interface and ImageFigure default implementation added
      to drawing framework.</li>
    <li>Enhanced SVG sample application.</li>
    <li>Removed NanoXML-Lite library.</li>
    <li>All code is now compilable with J2SE6. The minimum platform requirements
      for JHotDraw 7 remains J2SE5.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.0.7<br />
      <font size="-1">2006-11-12</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reorganized file structure.</li>
    <li>Fixed NetBeans project files and Ant build scripts.</li>
    <li>Fixed guide.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.0.6<br />
      <font size="-1">2006-08-27</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Renamed PlasmaDraw to JHotDraw 7.</li>
    <li>Changed copyright notices in all source files.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JHotDraw&nbsp;7.0.5<br />
      <font size="-1">2006-07-30</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Moved all packages from ch.randelshofer to org.jhotdraw.</li>
    <li>Reimplemented the 'Net' and 'Pert' sample applications.</li>
    <li>Implemented an 'SVG' sample application.</li>
    <li>Fixed  minor issues here and there.</li>
    <li>Added a tweaked version fo NanoXML back into the framework. The tweaked
      version of NanoXML allows to read XML documents which have a DTD, without
      opening a network connection to the DTD document and thus improving performance
      when opening a XML document.<br />
      Once we figure out, how can use the javax.xml API in a more performant
      way, we might throw out NanoXML again.</li>
